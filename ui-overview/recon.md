# Recon

On the main Recon page, you can see an at-a-glance overview of the current wireless landscape, with a list of discovered APs and their associated clients, unassociated clients, and clients that have gone out of range in table form.

To change to a mobile friendly view, select the card button next to the table icon in the **Access Points & Clients** card.

By clicking on an AP or Client in the list, a side menu will slide out from the right. From here you can select options specific to the type of device you selected, such as capturing handshakes or cloning, or adding MAC addresses to the Filters.

Switching to the Handshakes tab allows you to view any captured handshakes. Handshakes are captured in **PCAP** and **Hashcat's 22000** format.
