# Password Reset

On firmware versions 1.1.0 and later, you may reset a lost password by holding the Reset button for 7 seconds or longer. Upon success, the LED will flash a rainbow colour sequence and reboot.

After the device reboots, you will be able to login with the password `hak5pineapple`. You are advised to change this after logging in.
